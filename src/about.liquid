      <p>
        I'm Mario Alberto Chávez, a software engineer, entrepreneur, and visual
        artist based in Colima, México. For over 15 years, I've been working
        with Ruby on Rails—from building enterprise-scale systems to crafting
        developer tools that make our work more intuitive.
      </p>

      <p>
        As CTO and co-founder of Aoorora, I architected a core banking platform
        in Ruby on Rails that enabled lending startups to build fintech products
        without creating infrastructure from scratch. While the startup didn't
        survive, building a compliant banking platform taught me invaluable
        lessons about security, regulatory requirements, and architectural
        decisions at scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Aoorora, I co-founded michelada.io, a Rails consultancy serving
        clients from early-stage startups to companies like Levi's and US
        healthcare providers. Leading a 70-person engineering team taught me
        that the best technology solutions come from understanding both the code
        and the people who write it.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days, I'm exploring the convergence of Rails and AI. I created the
        Rails MCP Server to integrate AI assistants directly into Rails
        workflows, and continue building tools like my Rails upgrade assistant
        skill while documenting "vibecoding"—my approach to iterative
        development with AI.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also passionate about education. My Spanish-language course
        "Aprendiendo Ruby on Rails" (railsenespanol.co) teaches developers to
        build modern applications using Rails' no-build philosophy with Hotwire,
        Turbo, and StimulusJS—no complex JavaScript pipelines needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of software, I'm a contemporary photographer working on projects
        about territory, popular culture, and memory. My first photobook is
        currently in production.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're working on something at the intersection of Rails and AI, I'd
        love to hear from you.
